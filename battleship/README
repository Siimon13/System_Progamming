This is the game of battleship. 
Controls:

Enter- brings you to command prmopt where you position your ships and attack the opponent
F4- tells you the coordinates of the enemy
F5- Close

The computer randomly chooses coordinates on the field and puts 3 ships on he field. A destoryer(2x1), a crusier(3x1), and a tanker(5x1). Your goal is to find and destory them all, before they destory all your ships. The coordinates you placed for the ship can only be vertical and horoziontal. They must be realtive to each other. 

Bugs
If you enter an invalid space a bunch of times, the game will break. Once you do the 28th move, the AI starts to act weird.
